/**
 * This class is responsible for everything which concerns the graphical
 * appearance of symbols (hieroglyphs, editorial markup...)
 *
 * It doesn't deal with scaling and the like, as scaling is provided by the
 * graphics environment.
 *
 * <p>
 * This interface should probably not contain methods like getHeightOfA1 or
 * isKnown, which is really very specific to hieroglyphs.
 * <p>
 * The reason is historical: this interface was in the beginning only devoted to
 * glyphs. But now, the environment for hieroglyphs has been extended (to
 * philological markup and even text recently).
 * <p>
 * It doesn't deal with unkown or undefined codes.
