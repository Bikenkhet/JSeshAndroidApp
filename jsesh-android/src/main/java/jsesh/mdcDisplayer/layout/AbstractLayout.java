/**
 * An utility implementation of layout.
 * <p>To write an actual "Layouter", extends this class and 
 * overwrite the visit.... methods inherited from the ModelElementAdapter.
 * 
 * <p>In these methods, the view to layout is accessible as "currentView".
 * 
 * <p>Note that layout is not supposed to be called recursively. 
 * The recursion is done through ViewBuilder.
 *  
 * <p> When layout is called on a view, the following conditions can be supposed to be fullfilled :
 * <ul>
 * <it> the subview for the current view exist.
 * <it> layout has been already called on these subviews.
 * </ul>
 * 
 * <p> The visitor you write should do the following :
 * <ul>
 * <it> compute and set currentView's dimensions (using the subviews and the associated element) ;
 * <it> setting the scale and position of subviews.
 * <it> it is possible to change the scale of currentview.
 * </ul>
 * <p> However, the position of the currentview is supposed to be set from its parentview, so don't change it.
