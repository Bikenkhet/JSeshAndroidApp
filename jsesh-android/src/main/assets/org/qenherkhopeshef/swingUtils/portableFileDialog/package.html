	<p>Dialog system for files, which uses the "best" (as decided by me) way to ask for a file or a directory.
	Uses either the Swing or the native AWT file dialogs, depending on the operation and on the 
	system.</p>
	
	<p> Favors functionalities if possible, but always takes a working solution.</p>
	
	<p>To use this file dialog system, two classes are important : PortableFileDialogFactory, which is 
	to be used to create the dialog, and PortableFileDialog itself.</p>
