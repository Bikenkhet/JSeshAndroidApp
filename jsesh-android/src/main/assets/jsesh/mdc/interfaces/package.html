		This package contain a number of interfaces, which are used as <em>markers</em>
		in combination with the MDCModelBuilder interface and the parser, to generate 
		a model from a MDC text.
		
		<p> In practice, you write a class that implements MDCBuilder, and 
			generally creates objects from classes that implements the various 
			interfaces. have a look at 
			<a href="../implementation/MDCModelBuilder.html">MDCModelBuilder</a>
			and 
			<a href="../implementation/PrintMDCBuilder.html">PrintMDCBuilder</a> for examples.
