  	A new view system inspired by the one in JHotdraw (especially regarding the notion of drawing).
  	<p> In this system, the view contains all data needed to draw itself, without any explicit reference to the model.
  		It means much more freedom. We can for instance maintain a n-to-n mapping 
  		between model elements and view element, and reason on that basis.
