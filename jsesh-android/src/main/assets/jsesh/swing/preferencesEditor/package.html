An editor for the various software preferences.

<p>The architecture follows the "model-view-presenter" pattern, which is
quite suitable for static forms. The general architecture is the
following : each formular (generaly created with the great "abeille"
software) has absolutely no behaviour. Even buttons have no action
linked to them. Poor creatures.
<p>Then, the gallant presenter associated with a form (and whose name is
cleverly MyPresenter if the form is called MyForm) has a "prepare"
method which attaches behaviour to the form.
<p>Finally, the presenter has a loadFromPreferences() method which read
the data from a PreferenceFacade object, and an updatePreference()
method which sets the preferences values according to the user's choice.
