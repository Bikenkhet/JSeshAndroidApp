<!--
	The notion of variant used here is somehow ad-hoc.
	The problem of variants is that there are two different notions behind it, both useful in our software.
	The first notion is LINGUISTIC variant. A sign is a linguistic variant of another one if it has the same uses.
	For instance, Y2 is a linguistic variant of Y1. Now, Y2 also "looks like" Y1. We will call it a "graphical variation".
	Both notions are independant, though statistically linked. For instance, Z7 is a linguistic variant of G43, but not a 
	graphical variation thereof.
	  
	the notion of "looking like" another sign is covered by the "isSimilar" attribute.
	 
	In lots of cases, especially for determinatives, the signs are not always fully substitutable one for another.
	To allow the use of 'variant' information in searches, we introduce the "linguistic" attribute.
	
	let B be a variant of A.
	"full" means that all uses of B are also possible uses of A, and all uses of A are uses of B.
	"other" means that B is more specific than A, or that the degree is unknown
	"partial" means that the uses of A and B intersect, but they have also both significantly different uses.
		For instance, the D36 sign (ayin) is a partial variant of D37 (di), as D36 can write "di". However,
		in this case, I would not consider D37 as a variant of D36, because it would cause more harm than good.
	"no" is used when the sign is not at all a linguistic variant. In this case, isSimilar is normally "y".

<!-- the main purporse of transliteration is helping someone to find a sign. -->
<!-- a few more information help here -->
<!--
    the "use" attribute explain where the transliteration will be visible in JSesh.
	'keyboard' means the sign is typical of this transliteration, i.e. it should be used 
	in the main software when using "space" to circle among possible signs.
	'palette' means the sign is a not-too-unusual value for a given transliteration.
	it should be accessible through the palette.
	'informative' means the value is here for informative purposes only.
	
	type allows one to specify whence the value comes. It might be that a sign is a real
	phonogram (e.g. G1 for aleph), or an ideogram, or abbreviation, or simply be typical of certain words (e.g. "bin" is not 
	really a value for G37 ; but it's typical. G37 however is a known abbreviation for Sri.

<!-- A phantom is a redundant code. It states that a given code is the exact equivalent of another one.
     This can be used for normalization purposes. For instance, There are a few signs which have different encodings 
     in winglyph, JSesh, and Inscribe. The use of phantom a) avoids having multiple signs
     and b) allows to create a normalized text.
