Deals with hieroglyphic signs in general: drawing and values.
<p>The data can be drawn from various sources: internal data, external
files, database...
<p>The system should work with no configuration, but should allow
alternate sources to be used. The whole thing should be independant from
the JSesh main application.
<p>The solution is to provide a singleton implementation,
DefaultHieroglyphicFontManager. This implementation will allow for some
tayloring. However, if one wants full freedom on the subject, all
classes that use hieroglyphs should be able to use the source of their
choice.
