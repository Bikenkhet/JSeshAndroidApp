	The main JSesh application.
	<p> TODO :
	<ul>
	<li>Allow the edition of multiple documents</li>
	<li>Give the global application a better structure. In particular, the
		various possible actions should be treated independantly from the main application
		(though plug-in mecanism or, better, an xml configuration file).
		
		This would provide a cleaner interface, easier to maintain.
	</ul>
